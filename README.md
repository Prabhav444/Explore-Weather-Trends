# Exploring Weather Trends

## Project Overview
This project analyzes long-term temperature trends, comparing the average temperature of a specific city (Delhi) with global temperature trends. The primary objective is to identify and visualize patterns in climate change over time, utilizing historical data.

## Dataset
- **Source:** The data is sourced from publicly available climate data repositories.
- **Content:** The dataset includes yearly average temperatures for Delhi and globally, spanning a period of 176 years.

## Objectives
- **Trend Analysis:** Explore and compare the temperature trends of Delhi with global averages.
- **Data Smoothing:** Apply a rolling average to the dataset to smooth out short-term fluctuations and highlight long-term trends.
- **Visualization:** Create visual representations of the data to facilitate a clear comparison between local and global climate patterns.

## Methodology
1. **Data Loading:** 
   - The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and initial exploratory analysis is conducted to understand the data's structure.
   
2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Data is cleaned, and a rolling average is applied to smooth the temperature trends.
   
3. **Trend Analysis:**
   - A 9-year rolling average is calculated for both the city (Delhi) and global temperature data to identify long-term trends.
   
4. **Visualization:**
   - Matplotlib is used to plot the temperature trends, providing a clear visual comparison between Delhi and global temperatures over the specified period.
   - The plot highlights key differences and similarities in temperature trends over time.

## Results
- **Temperature Trends:** The analysis reveals significant long-term trends in both Delhi and global temperatures, with noticeable patterns of warming over the 176-year period.
- **Comparison:** The visualization clearly shows how Delhi's temperature trends align or diverge from global patterns, offering insights into regional climate dynamics.

## Tools & Technologies
- **Programming Languages:** Python
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- **Techniques:** Rolling averages, data visualization, trend analysis

## Conclusion
The "Exploring Weather Trends" project provides valuable insights into climate patterns by comparing regional and global temperature trends. The use of rolling averages effectively smooths the data, revealing long-term trends that are critical for understanding climate change.

## Future Work
- **Extended Analysis:** Explore additional cities or regions to provide a more comprehensive understanding of global climate trends.
- **Advanced Modeling:** Incorporate predictive modeling techniques to forecast future temperature trends based on historical data.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Develop interactive visualizations to enable users to explore temperature trends across different time periods and locations.
